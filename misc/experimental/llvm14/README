PRE-INSTALL

POST-INSTALL

PRECAUTION

    Note, that updating major versions of llvm (in x.y.z changing x or y)
    requires rebuilding ports like xorg-server, mesa32, glu and the
    mesa3d-gallium driver as they depend on this port.

    Have revdep(1) point out potential candidates for rebuilds after the llvm
    update.
