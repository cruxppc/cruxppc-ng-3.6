Introduction

  What is CRUX PPC?

   CRUX PPC is  a port  for the Power  Architecture^(R) platform  of CRUX,  a
   lightweight and optimized GNU/Linux  distribution targeted at  experienced
   GNU/Linux users.  The  primary focus  of  this distribution  is  "keep  it
   simple", which  it  reflects  in a  simple  tar.xz-based  package  system,
   BSD-style initscripts,  and  a  relatively  small  collection  of  trimmed
   packages. The secondary focus is utilization of new Linux kernel  features
   and recent tools  and libraries. CRUX  PPC also has  a ports system  which
   makes it easy to install and upgrade applications.

  Why use CRUX PPC?

   There are many GNU/Linux distributions out there these days, so what makes
   this distribution any better than the  others? Well, it's all about  taste
   really. Here are  a few hints  about the  tastes and goals  of the  people
   behind CRUX PPC. CRUX PPC is  made with simplicity in mind from  beginning
   to end. Making it easy to create new and update old packages is essential;
   updating a package in CRUX PPC is  often just a matter of typing pkgmk  -d
   -u (or prt-get update). The usage of ports helps keep your packages up-to-date;
   not the latest bleeding-edge-alpha version, but the latest stable version.
   Other features include creating packages optimized for your processor, eg.
   by  compiling  with   -mcpu=G4  -maltivec   -mabi=altivec,  and   avoiding
   cluttering the filesystem  with files  you'll never  use, eg.  /usr/doc/*,
   etc. If you  need more information  about a specific  program, other  than
   information found in the man-page, a  web search engine usually knows  all
   about it.  Finally,  it  strives  to  use  new  features  as  they  become
   available, as long as they are consistent with the rest of the goals.

   If you are a  somewhat experienced GNU/Linux user  that wants a clean  and
   solid GNU/Linux  distribution  as  the foundation  of  your  installation,
   prefers editing configuration  files with an  editor to using  a GUI,  and
   doesn't hesitate  to download  and compile  programs yourself,  then  this
   distribution might suit you well.

Installing CRUX PPC

  Supported Hardware

   Packages  on  the  official   CRUX  PPC  ISO   image  are  compiled   with
   optimizations to support Power Architecture(R) processors.  The packages
   should be compatible with any machine which supports the classic
   PowerPC instruction set.  However, the CRUX PPC installer is strongly
   oriented for Apple NewWorld (G3, G4, 32 bit only).   

   A minimum of 256Meg of RAM is needed to boot the install CD and
   install CRUX PPC 3.6.   However, the CRUX user may find the time needed
   to compile additional CRUX packages on lower end machines to be quite
   lengthy.

   CRUX can be installed in as little as 2 Gig of disk space although 
   10 to 20 Gig is a more reasonable value and adding on many packages 
   could require 100Gig or more of disk space.

  Installing From CD-ROM

   Prior to installing CRUX PPC, it is important to make a backup copy of
   any data on the installation system that may be of importance.   
   Although unlikely, it is possible that attempting to install CRUX PPC
   on your system could in some way damage existing data on the system.  To
   ensure that you don't lose anything of importance, back it up first.

   1.   Download   the   CRUX    PPC   ISO   image   (crux-ppc-3.6.iso    or
   similar naming). To  ensure  that  the download  was  successful  you
   should examine its checksum using md5sum.
   Compare   the   output   with    the   file   crux-ppc-3.6.iso.md5    (or
   crux-ppc64-3.6.iso.md5), which can be found in the same directory as  the
   ISO image on the  download site. If the  checksums match the download  was
   successful and you can continue with burning the ISO image on a CD.

   Note that you must use a CD, not DVD, for burning the image.   For 
   yet unknown reasons, CRUXPPC install does not work from a DVD media.

   2. The ISO  image is bootable,  on Apple computers  just insert the  newly
   burned CD into the first CD-ROM drive, reboot your computer and keep the C
   key pressed to boot from CD. Select  at the boot prompt press return 
   to install on apple32 machines.

   Note On some systems you might have to adjust the root= parameter (that
   defaults to /dev/sr0) to your cdrom device. Please keep in mind that
   device names vary according to your hardware configuration: The first
   SCSI, SATA (or EFIKA IDE) disk is called /dev/sda, while the first SCSI
   cdrom is called /dev/scd0 or /dev/sr0; the first IDE disk or cdrom is
   called /dev/sda too. For more information about harddisk naming
   conventions please checkout this HOWTO.

   Some systems have slower startup CDROM drives and you may need to 
   specifiy a larger rootdelay than the default.   e.g.  "rootdelay=45"

   2a.  CRUX PPC can (on most machines) be installed from a USB stick
   rather than a CDROM.  Creating the usb stick and booting it is 
   described in a seperate document in the cruxppc repository (TBA).

   3. Login as root (no password required).

   4. Use mac-fdisk (on Macs) to create and then format the partition(s)
   you want CRUX PPC to be installed on.  

  $ mac-fdisk /dev/sd?
  $ mkfs.ext4 /dev/sd??
  $ mkswap /dev/sd??

   Partitioning of a hard drive is very dependent on the individual users
   needs and decisions.   It's not possible to provide a description of
   partitioning that addresses every possible choice.   The Gentoo PPC
   handbook has a good explanation of disk partitioning and it might be
   useful to review that (and other such documents on the internet) to 
   help figure out  the proper partitioning for your system.

   A simple paritioning for a CRUX PPC system could be as follows:

   Partition 1:  Apple partition map.
   Partition 2:  800K Apple bootstrap partition.
   Partition 3:  1G /boot partition.  (For kernels and ramdisks.  format as ext2).
   Partition 4:  2G swap partition.
   Partition 5:  2G (at the very least) root (/) partition.

   Additional partitions would be needed for dual boot systems or for
   other user specific needed.

   Note A special bootstrap partition of 800k is needed to install the yaboot
   loader on Macs; mac-fdisk has a special key to do this. Also consider that
   yaboot can't read kernel images from JFS and Ext4fs partitions, so if you
   intend to use those as root filesystem, a supplementary ext2/ext3
   partition is needed to store the boot kernel images. Please note that
   mac-fdisk works with existing MacOS partition tables, it can create/delete
   partitions on a drive with MacOS installed; cfdisk and fdisk do not
   recognize MacOS partition table and will destroy it creating a PC
   compatible table from which you won't be able to boot, so use mac-fdisk on
   Apple computers.
   
   The amount of disk space you need depends on how many packages you  choose
   to install. It is recommend to have at least a 5G root partition (CRUX PPC will
   use about 500MB-1.5GB depending on your configuration).   

   Using   ReiserFS   is    possible,   but   there    is   support    for
   Ext2fs/Ext3fs/Ext4fs, XFS,  JFS  and  BTRFS as  well.  Further,  I  highly
   recommend separating  system data  from  user data,  i.e. use  a  separate
   partition for /home (and possibly /var)  since that will make your life  a
   lot easier the day you want to upgrade/reinstall/remove your system.

   5. Mount the partition on which you want to install this distribution.

  $ mount -t type /dev/sd?? /mnt

   If you want the installation to span more than one partition, mount  those
   partitions as well. For example, if you want to have a different partition
   for /home or /var, then do:

  $ mkdir /mnt/var
  $ mount -t type /dev/sd?? /mnt/var

   6. Activate your swap partition(s).   (Not needed on larger RAM systems)

  $ swapon /dev/sd??

   7. Type setup to  start the package installation  script. The script  will
   ask where you mounted your new root partition and which packages you  want
   to install. Just  select the packages  you want and  nothing else will  be
   installed. However,  I  recommend at  least  installing all  the  packages
   marked core.  Also git (from opt) is also recommended as it is used
   for updates of the powerpc specific portions of the ports tree.

   It is suggested to install either all of "core" or all of "core", "opt" and 
   "xorg" (and "lxde" if desired) to ensure that all dependencies are satisfied.
   Selecting individual packages within collections is not recommended but if
   you choose to do so, spend some time after installation verifying that 
   all expected dependencies are installed.

   Once it has installed the selected packages, the setup script will display
   an installation log. Make sure the last line in the log says "0 error(s)".

   If you at a later  stage find that you  need some additional packages  you
   can just mount the CRUX PPC CD-ROM and use pkgadd to install them.  In this
   case, ensure that you also install package dependencies.

   Note There is only a simple package dependency checking. This means that
   it is up to you to figure out that if you for example install the exim
   package you also need to install the db package.

   Note that unlike previous crux ppc install cds, the kernel source is
   not automatically installed into the target system.  A pre built
   kernel binary is included under /crux/kernel.   

   A prebuilt starter kernel tarball is provided on the install CD
   (look in /crux/kernel).   If desired, it can be copied to the target 
   system and used as a quick start kernel. e.g:

   cd /crux/kernel
   tar xvf cruxppc_kern_102220.tar.xz -C /mnt 

   (The actual name of the prebuilt kernel may vary from release to
    release...)

   The users other option is to build the initial kernel from source 
   as part of the CRUX install.  The kernel source is not included on the 
   install CD so if a kernel build is desired, the kernel source will 
   need to be loaded via USB stick or otherwise.

   If you are installing onto a machine with smaller amounts of DRAM 
   (e.g. 128 Meg), you may need to create and add a swap partition prior
   to making locales, building the kernel, etc.   
   
   Part of installing CRUX is that the user must generate the locales.  A
   script containing a small subset (of the many possible) locales is
   provided on the install CD (in /crux/makelocales).   Copy it to your
   target system, modify it as needed for your needs, and then later execute 
   it from within the installed system.

   A few of the packages available on the install CD have associated
   "post-install" scripts that perform important package post install
   work.  The install CD does not run these scripts automatically and 
   you may wish to run them manually.   To assist this, a directory
   "post-installs" is provided under /crux.   Copy this directory to
   your target system and run them either as chroot or shortly after
   you first boot up your CRUX system.

   e.g.  To copy the 'helper' scripts to the installed system, do:

   cd /crux
   cp -r makelocales post-installs portsnapshot*.xz /mnt/root 
   
   The contents of the 'helper' files may be useful once the 
   user logs (or chroots) into the newly installed system.  "makelocales"
   helps with locale creation, "post-installs" helps ensure that the
   installed packages have properly run their post-install scripts and
   portsnapshot*.xz is a reference copy of the ports tree at the time the
   install CD was created.  The ports tree is normally populated 
   from the online ports repositorie(s) but a copy of what was
   used to create the install packages may be useful for reference and 
   so is provided by the portsnapshot tarball.

   8. Now it's time to install your kernel and do basic system configuration.
   The kernel compilation requires that you  "chroot" into your new CRUX  PPC
   installation.   When using the prebuilt kernel, chroot is not, strictly
   speaking, required but is easiest to complete the configuration steps
   from chroot, so is best to chroot in either case.

  $ mount --bind /dev /mnt/dev
  $ mount --bind /tmp /mnt/tmp
  $ mount --bind /run /mnt/run
  $ mount -t proc proc /mnt/proc
  $ mount -t sysfs none /mnt/sys
  $ mount -t devpts -o noexec,nosuid,gid=tty,mode=0620 devpts /mnt/dev/pts
  $ chroot /mnt /bin/bash

   You can  type setup-chroot  instead of  issuing the  previous commands  to
   chroot in the system installed in /mnt

   9. Set the root password.

  $ passwd

   10. Edit /etc/fstab to configure your filesystem(s). Editors vim, and nano
   are available.

   NA WIP: NOTE If you want access your computer via serial console (as it should be
   for IBM RS/6000, pSeries, Apple Xserve or Genesi EFIKA users) you also
   have to add ttyS0 (ttyPZ0 for Xserve or ttyPSC0 for EFIKA) in the
   /etc/securetty and c7:2:respawn:/sbin/agetty 9600 ttyS0
   (c7:2:respawn:/sbin/agetty 57600 ttyPZ0 for Xserve or
   c7:2:respawn:/sbin/agetty 115200 ttyPSC0 for EFIKA) in the /etc/inittab
   file. For IBM Power Systems (POWER5 and newer) and PPC970 cpu based
   systems if you want access your computer via serial console (and to have a
   working prompt using keyboard/monitor too) you also have to add hvsi0 or
   hvc0 in the /etc/securetty and c7:2:respawn:/sbin/agetty 19200 hvsi0 (or
   c7:2:respawn:/sbin/agetty hvc0) in the /etc/inittab file.

   11. Edit /etc/rc.conf to configure font, keyboard, timezone, hostname  and
   services. See Section 6.1.3,  Configuration Variables in /etc/rc.conf  for
   details about /etc/rc.conf .   It may also be useful to enable sshd at this
   time.

   12. Generate  locales  for  your system.  See  Section  6.1.4,  Generating
   Locales for more information.  A 'makelocales' script is provided which
   may be helpful in this process.   To use it simply edit it and make
   any needed changes and then type "makelocales".   It takes some
   minutes to complete.

   12a.  Run the post-install scripts by entering the directory 
   /root/post-installs and running the script "POST.sh".   POST.sh will run
   post-install scripts for those installed packages which require
   a post-install.

   13. If needed, edit /etc/rc.d/net, /etc/hosts and /etc/resolv.conf to 
   configure  your network (ip-address/gateway/hostname/domain/dns).   

   14. Install kernel:

   Classic CRUX installation expects the user to build and install their own
   kernel.   This can be quite a long process on PowerPC machines so
   CRUX PPC also provides the alternative of installing a prebuilt starter
   kernel.   If you already installed the pre-built kernel, for now skip this step 
   and sometime after install is completed, the user can build their own
   kernel that better suits their specific needs.

   NVIDIA ugly hack tip:  If you are installing a kernel onto a machine with an 
   nvidia graphics card (not likely), remove the modules under drivers/char/agp, 
   otherwise, the screen may be garbled and essentially unusable upon boot.  CRUX
   PPC is not recommended for machines with NVIDA graphics cards.

   If you wish to build your own kernel, unpack the linux-4.19.xx tarball,
   (typically into /usr/src/linux-4.19.x) configure and compile it.

   On a 32 bit system:

     * for Apple

  $ cd /usr/src/linux-4.19.24.x
  $ patch -p1 < ../your_patch   (if you have one)
  $ make menuconfig
  $ make all
  $ make modules_install
  $ cp System.map /boot/System.map
  $ cp vmlinux /boot
  $ cp arch/powerpc/boot/zImage.pmac /boot/zImage  (needed ?)

   Useful kernel  config  files and  (maybe) patches  can be found in 
   /crux/kernel/*config.

   15. On Apple computers, edit /etc/yaboot.conf to boot the kernel you  just
   compiled  and  run  mkofboot  -v  to  install  yaboot  into  the  boostrap
   partition, then ybin -v to make the new system bootable.  

   A sample.yaboot.conf file can be found under /etc/ and may be useful as
   a starting point for creating the needed yaboot.conf.

   Note that if you are installing CRUX-PPC in a dual boot configuration
   with an other OS, you will need to obtain and modify the other OSs existing
   yaboot.conf file rather than writing a new one.

   16. Remove the CRUX PPC CD-ROM from your drive and reboot from harddisk.

  Upgrading From CD-ROM

   Upgrading from a previous crux ppc to crux ppc 3.6 is not supported.  
   You may try it if you wish but it is not likely to work.   

   1.   Download   the   CRUX    PPC   ISO   image   (crux-ppc-3.6.iso    or
   crux-ppc64-3.6.iso). To  ensure  that  the download  was  successful  you
   should examine its checksum using md5sum.
   Compare   the   output   with    the   file   crux-ppc-3.6.iso.md5    (or
   crux-ppc64-3.6.iso.md5), which can be found in the same directory as  the
   ISO image on the  download site. If the  checksums match the download  was
   successful and you can continue with burning the ISO image on a CD.

   2. The ISO  image is bootable,  on Apple computers  just insert the  newly
   burned CD-ROM into the first CD-ROM  drive, reboot your computer and  keep
   the C key  pressed to  boot from  CD-ROM. Select  at the  boot prompt  the
   kernel chrp32 for  604e cpu  based systems,  apple32 for  G3/G4 cpu  based
   systems, apple64  and ppc970  for  G5 cpu  based  systems or  pseries  for
   RS64/POWERn cpu based machines.

   3. Login as root (no password required).

   4. Mount your CRUX PPC root partition.

  $ mount -t type /dev/sd?? /mnt

   If your installation spans over more than one partition, then mount  those
   partitions as well.  For example, if  you have a  different partition  for
   /var, then do:

  $ mount -t type /dev/sd?? /mnt/var

   5. Activate your swap partition(s).

  $ swapon /dev/sd??

   6. Type setup to  start the package installation  script. The script  will
   ask you where you mounted your root partition and which packages you  want
   to upgrade. It is a good idea to upgrade all packages, else you might  get
   into trouble later, e.g. in case a new version of some library isn't  100%
   backwards compatible.

   Note The setup script uses the /etc/pkgadd.conf of the target system to
   determine which files to upgrade and which files not to upgrade. The files
   that are not upgraded are put in /var/lib/pkg/rejected/ (Section 4.2.2,
   Upgrading a Package).

   When the setup script  has upgraded the selected  packages an upgrade  log
   will be displayed. Make sure the last line in the log says "0 error(s)".

   If you at a later  stage find that you  need some additional packages  you
   can just mount the CRUX  PPC CD-ROM and use  pkgadd to install them  (e.g.
   pkgadd /mnt/crux/opt/package#1.0-1.pkg.tar.xz).

   7. Now it's time to compile  your kernel. The kernel compilation  requires
   that you "chroot" into your CRUX PPC installation.

  $ mount -o bind /dev /mnt/dev
  $ chroot /mnt /bin/bash

   8. Go to /usr/src/linux-4.19.24.x, patch (if needed), configure and compile
   a new kernel.
   Useful kernel  config  files and  patches  are placed  into  the  /usr/src
   directory. They  are the  config files  used to  build the  boot  kernels.
   Adjust /etc/fstab if needed.

   WARNING udev reads files in /sys/* and /proc/*. Make sure that those
   pseudo filesystems are enabled in your kernel configuration and available
   during system-startup. Also note that unlike devfsd, udev doesn't
   automatically mount /dev/pts. Terminal applications such as xterm(1) will
   not work if you forget to mount it. If you want udev to detect your
   connected USB hardware you'll need the USB-Filesystem mounted on

The Package System

  Introduction

   The package system (pkgutils) is made  with simplicity in mind, where  all
   packages are plain  tar.xz files  (i.e. without  any kind  of meta  data).
   Packages          follow          the          naming           convention
   <name>#<version>-<release>.pkg.tar.xz, where  <name> is  the name  of  the
   program, <version> is the version number of the program, and <release>  is
   the version  number  of the  package.  The pkg.tar.xz  extension  is  used
   (instead of just  tar.xz) to  indicate that this  is not  just any  tar.gz
   file, but a tar.xz that is meant to be installed using pkgadd. This way it
   is easy to tell packages apart from other tar.xz files.

   pkgadd(8), pkgrm(8), pkginfo(8), and  pkgmk(8) are the package  management
   utilities. With these utilities you can install, uninstall, inspect,  make
   packages and query the package database.

   When a package  is installed using  pkgadd a  new record is  added to  the
   package database  (stored in  /var/lib/pkg/db). The  basic package  system
   does not have any kind of dependency  checking, thus it will not warn  you
   if you install a package that requires other packages to be installed. The
   included prt-get tools, however, do support dependencies when installing
   from source.   If you pkgadd binary packages dependency checking, 
   and taking care of any pre or post install requirements is up to the user.

   The following  sections will  in short  describe how  to use  the  package
   utilities. Additional information  about these utilities  can be found  on
   their respective man page.

  Using the Package System

    Installing a Package

   Installing a package  is done by  using pkgadd. This  utility requires  at
   least one argument, the package you want to install. Example:

  $ pkgadd bash#3.2.33-1.pkg.tar.xz

   When installing  a  package  the  package  manager  will  ensure  that  no
   previously installed  files are  overwritten. If  conflicts are  found  an
   error message will be printed and pkgadd will abort without installing the
   package. The  error message  will  contain the  names of  the  conflicting
   files. Example:

  $ pkgadd bash#3.2.33-1.pkg.tar.xz
  bin/sh
  usr/man/man1/sh.1.gz
  pkgadd error: listed file(s) already installed (use -f to ignore and overwrite)

   To force the installation and overwrite the conflicting files you can  use
   the option -f (or --force). Example:

  $ pkgadd -f bash#3.2.33-1.pkg.tar.xz

   The package system allows a file to be owned by exactly one package.  When
   forcing an installation  the ownership  of the conflicting  files will  be
   transferred to the package that is currently being installed.  Directories
   can however be owned by more than one package.

   WARNING It is often not a good idea to force the installation unless you
   really know what you are doing. If a package conflicts with already
   installed files it could be a sign that the package is broken and installs
   unexpected files. Use this option with extreme care, preferably not at
   all.

   As said earlier the  package file itself does  not contain any meta  data.
   Instead the package  manager uses  the package filename  to determine  the
   package name  and version.  Thus,  when installing  a package  file  named
   bash#3.2.33-1.pkg.tar.xz the  package manager  will  interpret this  as  a
   package named bash at version 3.2.33-1.  If pkgadd is unable to  interpret
   the filename  (e.g.  #  is missing  or  the  filename does  not  end  with
   .pkg.tar.xz) an  error  message will  be  printed and  pkgadd  will  abort
   without installing the package.

    Upgrading a Package

   Upgrading a package is done using pkgadd with the -u option. Example:

  $ pkgadd -u bash#3.2.33-1.pkg.tar.xz

   This will replace the previously installed bash package with the new  one.
   If you have  not previously  installed bash,  pkgadd will  print an  error
   message. The package system does not care about the version number of  the
   package in that you can "upgrade" version 3.2.33-1 with version 2.04-1 (or
   even with version 3.2.33-1 itself). The installed package will be replaced
   with the specified package.

   Upgrading a package is  equivalent to executing  pkgrm followed by  pkgadd
   with one (big) exception.  When upgrading a package  (with pkgadd -u)  you
   have the  option to  prevent  some of  the  already installed  files  from
   getting replaced.  This is  typically  useful when  you want  to  preserve
   configuration and log files.

   When executing pkgadd the  file /etc/pkgadd.conf will  be read. This  file
   can contain rules describing how pkgadd should behave when doing upgrades.
   A rule is  built out of  three fragments; event,  pattern and action.  The
   event describes in  what kind  of situation this  rule applies.  Currently
   only one type of  event is supported,  that is UPGRADE.  The pattern is  a
   filename  pattern  expressed  as  a  regular  expression  and  the  action
   applicable to the UPGRADE event  is YES or NO. More  than one rule of  the
   same event type is  allowed, in which  case the first  rule will have  the
   lowest priority and the last rule will have the highest priority. Example:

   #
   # /etc/pkgadd.conf: pkgadd(8) configuration
   #

   UPGRADE         ^etc/.*$                NO
   UPGRADE         ^var/log/.*$            NO
   UPGRADE         ^etc/X11/.*$            YES
   UPGRADE         ^etc/X11/xorg.conf$     NO

   # End of file

   The above example will cause pkgadd to never upgrade anything in /etc/  or
   /var/log/   (subdirectories   included),   except   files   in   /etc/X11/
   (subdirectories included), unless it  is the file /etc/X11/xorg.conf.  The
   default rule is to upgrade everything,  rules in this file are  exceptions
   to that rule.

   Note A pattern should never contain an initial "/" since you are referring
   to the files in the package, not the files on the disk.

   If pkgadd  finds that  a specific  file  should not  be upgraded  it  will
   install it under /var/lib/pkg/rejected/. Files in this directory are never
   added to  the package  database. The  user is  then free  to examine,  use
   and/or remove that file manually. Another  option is to use rejmerge.  For
   each rejected file found in /var/lib/pkg/rejected/, rejmerge will  display
   the difference between the installed version and the rejected version. The
   user can  then  choose to  keep  the  installed version,  upgrade  to  the
   rejected version or perform a merge  of the two. Example (using the  above
   /etc/pkgadd.conf):

   $ pkgadd -u bash#3.2.33-1.pkg.tar.xz
   pkgadd: rejecting etc/profile, keeping existing version
   $ ls /var/lib/pkg/rejected/
   etc/
   $ ls /var/lib/pkg/rejected/etc/
   profile

    Removing a Package

   Removing a  package is  done by  using pkgrm.  This utility  requires  one
   argument, the name of the package you want to remove. Example:

  $ pkgrm bash

   WARNING This will remove all files owned by the package, no questions
   asked. Think twice before doing it and make sure that you did not misspell
   the package name since that could remove something completely different
   (e.g. think about what could happen if you misspelled glib as glibc).

    Querying the Package Database

   Querying the package database  is done using pkginfo.  This utility has  a
   few options to answer different queries.

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Option                  | Description                                 ||
   |-------------------------+---------------------------------------------||
   | -i, --installed         | List installed packages and their version.  ||
   |-------------------------+---------------------------------------------||
   | -l, --list package|file | List files owned by the specified package   ||
   |                         | or contained in file                        ||
   |-------------------------+----------------------------------------------|
   | -o, --owner pattern     | List owner(s) of file(s) matching pattern.   |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Examples:

  $ pkginfo -i
   atk 1.20.0-1
   autoconf 2.61-1
   automake 1.10-1
   <...>
   yaboot 1.3.14-1
   zip 2.32-1
   zlib 1.2.3-1

   $ pkginfo -l bash
   bin/
   bin/bash
   bin/sh
   etc/
   etc/profile
   usr/
   usr/man/
   usr/man/man1/
   usr/man/man1/bash.1.gz
   usr/man/man1/sh.1.gz

   $ pkginfo -l grep#2.5.3-1.pkg.tar.xz
   usr/
   usr/bin/
   usr/bin/egrep
   usr/bin/fgrep
   usr/bin/grep
   usr/man/
   usr/man/man1/
   usr/man/man1/egrep.1.gz
   usr/man/man1/fgrep.1.gz
   usr/man/man1/grep.1.gz

   $ pkginfo -o bin/ls
   Package            File
   coreutils          bin/ls
   e2fsprogs          usr/bin/lsattr
   module-init-tools  sbin/lsmod
   pciutils           usr/sbin/lspci
   usbutils           usr/sbin/lsusb

  Creating Packages

   Creating a package is  done using pkgmk. This  utility uses a file  called
   Pkgfile, which  contains  information about  the  package (such  as  name,
   version, etc) and the commands that should be executed in order to compile
   the package in question. To be more specific, the Pkgfile file is actually
   a bash(1)  script, which  defines a  number of  variables (name,  version,
   release and source) and a function (build). Below is an example of what  a
   Pkgfile file might look like. The example shows how to package the grep(1)
   utility. Some comments are inserted for explanation.

   # Specify the name of the package.
   name=grep

   # Specify the version of the package.
   version=2.4.2

   # Specify the package release.
   release=1

   # The source(s) used to build this package.
   source=(ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/$name/$name-$version.tar.xz)

   # The build() function below will be called by pkgmk when
   # the listed source files have been unpacked.
   build() {
      # The first thing we do is to cd into the source directory.
      cd $name-$version

      # Run the configure script with desired arguments.
      # In this case we want to put grep under /usr/bin and
      # disable national language support.
      ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-nls

      # Compile.
      make

      # Install the files, BUT do not install it under /usr, instead
      # we redirect all the files to $PKG/usr by setting the DESTDIR
      # variable. The $PKG variable points to a temporary directory
      # which will later be made into a tar.xz-file. Note that the
      # DESTDIR variable is not used by all Makefiles, some use prefix
      # and others use ROOT, etc. You have to inspect the Makefile in
      # question to find out. Some Makefiles do not support redirection
      # at all. In those cases you will have to create a patch for it.
      make DESTDIR=$PKG install

      # Remove unwanted files, in this case the info-pages.
      rm -rf $PKG/usr/info
   }

   In reality you do not include all those comments, thus the real Pkgfile
   for grep(1) looks like this:

   # Description: GNU grep, egrep and fgrep
   # URL:         http://www.gnu.org/software/grep/grep.html
   # Maintainer:  Per Lideacute;n, per at fukt dot bth dot se

   name=grep
   version=2.4.2
   release=1
   source=(ftp://ftp.ibiblio.org/pub/gnu/$name/$name-$version.tar.xz)

   build() {
     cd $name-$version
     ./configure --prefix=/usr --disable-nls
     make
     make DESTDIR=$PKG install
     rm -rf $PKG/usr/info
   }

   Note The build() function in the example above is just an example of how
   grep is built. The contents of the function can differ significantly if
   the program is build in some other way, e.g. does not use autoconf.

   When the build() function  has been executed, the  $PKG directory will  be
   made into  a package  named <name>#<version>-<release>.pkg.tar.xz.  Before
   the package creation  is completed, pkgmk  will check the  content of  the
   package against the .footprint file. If this file does not exist, it  will
   be created and the test will be skipped. The .footprint file will  contain
   a list  of all  files that  should  be in  the package  if the  build  was
   successful or a list of all the files that were installed in $PKG (if  the
   .footprint did not already  exist). If there is  a mismatch the test  will
   fail and  an error  message will  be  printed. You  should not  write  the
   .footprint file by hand. Instead, when a package has been upgraded and you
   need to update  the contents of  the .footprint file  you simply do  pkgmk
   -uf. This  test  ensures that  a  rebuild of  the  package turned  out  as
   expected.

   If the  package built  without errors  it's time  to install  it by  using
   pkgadd and  try it  out. I  highly  recommend looking  at the  Pkgfile  in
   another package(s), since looking at examples is a great way to learn.

    Adjusting/Configuring the Package Build Process

   Many settings pertaining to the package  build process can be adjusted  by
   editing the pkgmk(8)  configuration file /etc/pkgmk.conf  . Some of  these
   configurable settings include:

   * CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS - these settings control optimization and  architecture
   options for package compiles.  It is best NOT  to change these unless  you
   absolutely know what you're doing!

   * PKGMK_SOURCE_MIRRORS - this setting  defines locations from which  pkgmk
   will attempt to fetch source archives

   * PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR  - this  setting  defines where  pkgmk will  store  (if
   downloading) and use source archives when building

   * PKGMK_PACKAGE_DIR - this setting defines where pkgmk will create package
   files once the build process is complete

   * PKGMK_WORK_DIR -  this setting  defines a work  area pkgmk  will use  to
   build the package

   Here are some examples:

  PKGMK_SOURCE_MIRRORS=(http://fileserver.intranet/crux/sources/)

   This setting instructs pkgmk to attempt to fetch all source archives  from
   http://fileserver.intranet/crux/sources/ before falling back to the source
   URL specified in the Pkgfile. Multiple URLS can be separated by spaces.

  PKGMK_SOURCE_DIR="/usr/ports/srcfiles"

   This example  instructs  pkgmk  to  store  and  find  source  archives  in
   /usr/port/srcfiles . An example benefit of this setup would be the ability
   to store /usr/ports/srcfiles on  an NFS server on  your local network  for
   use by multiple crux installations. PKGMK_PACKAGE_DIR can be set and  used
   the same way.

  PKGMK_WORK_DIR="/usr/ports/work/$name"

   This example instructs pkgmk to  use /usr/ports/work/$name as a work  area
   for building the specified package. Building the grep package would result
   in the work area being /usr/ports/work/grep  . An alternative would be  to
   use a tmpfs as your work directory.
   There are a few  more settings which  can be found  in the pkgmk.conf  man
   page.

  Package Guidelines

    General

   * The name of  a package should always  be lowercase (e.g. name=eterm  and
   not name=Eterm). In case the package is added to the CRUX ports system the
   exact same name should be use for  the name of the directory in the  ports
   structure, i.e. /usr/ports/???/eterm.

   * Do not  combine several separately  distributed programs/libraries  into
   one package. Make several packages instead.

    Directories

   *  In  general  packages  should  install  files  in  these   directories.
   Exceptions are of course  allowed if there  is a good  reason. But try  to
   follow the following directory structure as close as possible.

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Directory          | Description                               |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/bin/          | User command/application binaries         |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/sbin/         | System binaries (e.g. daemons)            |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/lib/          | Libraries                                 |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/include/      | Header files                              |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/lib/<prog>/   | Plug-ins, addons, etc                     |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/man/          | Man pages                                 |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/share/<prog>/ | Data files                                |       |
   |--------------------+-------------------------------------------|       |
   | /usr/etc/<prog>/   | Configuration files                       |       |
   |--------------------+---------------------------------------------------|
   | /etc/              | Configuration files for system software (daemons, |
   |                    | etc)                                              |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   * /opt directory is reserved for manually compiled/installed applications.
   Packages should never place anything there.

   * /usr/libexec/ is not  used in CRUX, thus  packages should never  install
   anything there. Use /usr/lib/<prog>/ instead.

  Remove Junk Files

   * Packages should not contain "junk  files". This includes info pages  and
   other online documentation,  man pages excluded  (e.g. usr/doc/*,  README,
   *.info, *.html, etc).

   *  Files  related   to  NLS  (national   language  support),  always   use
   --disable-nls when available.

   *   Useless   or   obsolete    binaries   (e.g.   /usr/games/banner    and
   /sbin/mkfs.minix).

    Pkgfile

   * Do not add  new variables to  the Pkgfile. Only in  very few cases  does
   this actually  improve the  readability  or the  quality of  the  package.
   Further, the  only  variables  that  are guranteed  to  work  with  future
   versions of  pkgmk are  name, version,  release, and  source. Other  names
   could be in conflict with internal variables in pkgmk.

   * Use  the $name  and $version  variables to  make the  package easier  to
   update/maintain.                       For                        example,
   source=(http://xyz.org/$name-$version.tar.xz)     is      better      than
   source=(http://xyz.org/myprog-1.0.3.tar.xz)    since    the    URL    will
   automatically updated when you modify the $version variable.

   * Remember that source  is an array, i.e.  always do source=(...) and  not
   source=...

    Pkgfile Header

   Provide a header including the following fields:

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Name        | Meaning                                                 ||
   |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------||
   | Description | A short description of the package; keep it factual     ||
   |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------||
   | Maintainer  | Your full name and e-mail address, obfuscated if you    ||
   |             | want                                                    ||
   |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------||
   | Packager    | The original packager's full name and e-mail address    ||
   |-------------+---------------------------------------------------------||
   | URL         | A webpage with more information on this software        ||
   |             | package                                                 ||
   |-------------+----------------------------------------------------------|
   | Depends on  | A list of dependencies, separated either by spaces or    |
   |             | commas                                                   |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

   Depends on can be  omitted if there are  no dependencies; Packager can  be
   omitted if the maintainer and packager are the same person.
   Example header

   # Description: Terminal based IRC client for UNIX systems
   # URL: http://www.irssi.org/
   # Maintainer: Jukka Heino, jukka at karsikkopuu dot net
   # Packager: Daniel K. Gebhart, dkg at con-fuse dot org
   # Depends on: glib

   Note If your package specifically addresses the PPC platform, or if your
   Pkgfile is a modified version of an x86 package build file, please add an
   extra header field PPC!=upstream that explains what's different from x86
   and/or a field that indicates the PPC packager name like Modified version
   for PPC.

   Example PPC header:

   # Description: Mozilla Web Browser Component
   # URL: http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/
   # Maintainer: Matt Housh, jaeger at morpheus dot net
   # Modified version for PPC: http://cruxppc.sunsite.dk
   # Depends on: libidl, gtk, libpng, libjpeg, zlib
   # PPC!=upstream: footprint, mozconfig with ac_cv_visibility_pragma=no

The Ports System

  Introduction

    What is a Port?

   A port is a directory containing  the files needed for building a  package
   using pkgmk. This means that this directory at least has the files Pkgfile
   (which is the package build description) and .footprint (which is used for
   regression testing and contains a list  of files this package is  expected
   to contain  once it  is  built). Further,  a  port directory  can  contain
   patches and/or  other  files  needed  for  building  the  package.  It  is
   important to understand that the actual source code for the package is not
   necessarily present in port directory. Instead the Pkgfile contains an URL
   which points to a location where the source can be downloaded.

   The use of the word port in  this context is borrowed from the BSD  world,
   where a port  refers to  a program  that has been  ported to  a system  or
   platform. The word can sometimes be  a bit misleading since most  programs
   require no actual porting to run on CRUX (or on GNU/Linux in general).

  What is the Ports System?

   The term Ports System refers to a remote repository containing ports and a
   client program capable  of downloading  ports from  that repository.  CRUX
   users use the ports(8) utility to download ports from the repositorty  and
   place them in /usr/ports/. CRUX PPC  ports(8) utility syncs with both  the
   CRUX PPC repositories, whose copy is kept in /usr/ports/ppc, and the  CRUX
   repositories, whose copy is kept in /usr/ports/x86. The ports utility uses
   rsync(1) to do the actual  synchronization with the PPC repositories,  and
   rsync(1) to sync with the main CRUX repositories.

    Port collections

   CRUX ports are organized  in so called collections;  the CRUX PPC  project
   provides PPC specific collections that only contain ports that need to  be
   different on Power  Architecture than  CRUX upstream  (x86). Whenever  the
   user seeks for a port  and finds it in a  PPC repository, s/he should  use
   the PPC version instead of the CRUX upstream.
   There are three different layers of ports.

    The official collection 'opt', 'core' and 'xorg'

   x86/core, x86/opt and x86/xorg are the three primary collections of  CRUX.
   They're maintained by the CRUX development team which ensures that they're
   consistent and working well together.
   ppc/core, ppc/opt and ppc/xorg collections are maintained by the CRUX  PPC
   Team and  are meant  to override  the x86  ports when  there is  some  ppc
   specific issue  that prevents  the upstream  ports from  working on  Power
   Architecture. Those three x86 collections  and their ppc counterparts  are
   also enabled by default in CRUX PPC.

    The user contributed collection 'contrib'

   The x86/contrib  collection  is  a  relatively  new  collection  which  is
   provided  by  experienced  port  maintainers,   some  part  of  the   CRUX
   development team, some regular users. Its goal is to reduce the number  of
   duplicate ports  provided  in  the individual  collections.  If  you're  a
   seasoned port  maintainer,  you  might  even  want  to  join  the  contrib
   collection. The most of these ports should  work on CRUX PPC, but not  all
   of them  have  been  verified  by  The CRUX  PPC  Team  or  fixed  in  the
   ppc/contrib collection.

   The ppc/contrib collection  contains some special  PowerPC specific  ports
   not available in the upstream  contrib collection, and some contrib  ports
   adjusted for PPC.

   As those ports are not provided  officially by the CRUX development  team,
   this collection is disabled by default.

  Using the Ports System

    Synchronizing Your Local Ports Structure

   When CRUX PPC is  installed for the first  time the local ports  structure
   (/usr/ports/) is empty. To bring your local ports structure up to date you
   use the ports utility with the -u option. Example:

  $ ports -u

   The -u  option  means  update,  and  tells  ports  to  contact  the  ports
   repository and  download  new and  updated  ports. The  output  from  this
   execution is something like this:

   Updating file list from cruxppc.org::ports/core/3.6/
   Updating collection core
   ...
   Updating file list from cruxppc.org::ports/opt/3.6/
   Updating collection opt
   ...
   Updating file list from cruxppc.org::ports/xorg/3.6/
   Updating collection xorg
   ...
   Updating file list from crux.nu::ports/crux-3.6/core/
   Updating collection core
   ...
   Updating file list from crux.nu::ports/crux-3.6/opt/
   Updating collection opt
   ...
   Updating file list from crux.nu::ports/crux-3.6/xorg/
   Updating collection xorg
   ...
   Finished successfully

   The output reveals which files are downladed, updated and deleted.

   The user must manually install the -ppc portion of the ports tree as follows:

# git clone https://www.github.com/cruxppc/cruxppc-ng-3.6
# cd cruxppc-ng-3.6/ports
# cp -r * /usr/ports

    Listing Local Ports

   When the local ports structure has been updated the directory  /usr/ports/
   will contain two  package categories, base  and opt. Under  each of  these
   directories you  will find  ports. You  can simply  browse around  in  the
   directory structure to find out which ports are available.

  $ ls /usr/ports/ppc/core/
              ed          iptables            mlocate            sed
 acl          exim        iputils             module-init-tools  shadow

 autoconf     filesystem  kbd                 net-tools          sysfsutils
 automake     findutils   less                openrdate          sysklogd

 e2fsprogs    iproute2    man-pages           rsync              zlib


   You can also use ports with the -l option to list all local ports.
   Example:

   $ ports -l
   ppc/core/acl
   ppc/core/attr
   ppc/core/autoconf
   ppc/core/automake
   ppc/core/bash
   ppc/core/bc
   ppc/core/bindutils
   ppc/core/binutils
   ...

   If you are looking for a specific  package it might be easier to use  this
   approach (e.g. ports -l  | grep sendmail)  to find out  if the package  is
   available and if so in which category it is located.

    Listing Version Differences

   To find  out if  the  ports structure  carries  ports that  are  different
   (likely newer) compared to  the versions currently  installed you can  use
   the option -d. If version differences are found, the output from the above
   command could look something like this:

   $ ports -d
   Collection      Name     Port      Installed
   x86/core        glibc    2.6.1-2   3.6-1
   x86/opt         gtk      2.12.9-1  2.12.18-1

   If no version differences were found, i.e. the system is in sync with  the
   ports structure. Then output will simply be:

   $ ports -d
   No differences found

    Building and Installing Packages

   Once you have found a port that  you want to build and install you  simply
   go into the desired port directory and use pkgmk to build it. Example:

   $ cd /usr/ports/core/gawk
   $ pkgmk -d

   The -d  option means  download missing  source files  and tells  pkgmk  to
   download the source(s)  specified in the  Pkgfile (in case  the source  is
   already downloaded this option is ignored). When the download is completed
   the package will be built. If  the package was built successfully you  can
   use pkgadd to install or upgrade it. Example:

   $ pkgadd gawk#3.1.5-3.pkg.tar.xz

   To make life a bit  easier these two steps can  be made into one by  using
   the options -i (for install) or -u (for upgrade). Example:

   $ pkgmk -d -i

   or

   $ pkgmk -d -u

   This will download, build and then install/upgrade the package. Note  that
   the package will only be installed/upgraded if the build is successful.

    Enabling the 'contrib' collection

   As previously mentioned, the 'contrib' collection contains useful ports of
   experienced port  maintainers. Since  they are  not provided  by the  CRUX
   development team, you  should be  slightly more critical  with respect  to
   quality and security. Most members  of the 'contrib' collections are  well
   respected community members though.

   To enable it for ports, do

   $ cd /etc/ports
   $ mv contrib.rsync.inactive contrib.rsync

    Additional Tools

      Building ports as unprivileged user

   Normaly building  packages  requires  root-privileges.  This  is  critical
   because a malicious  or badly designed  port can damage  your system.  The
   fakeroot  command  provides  a  way   to  build  ports  as  normal   user.
   Particularly when you  build packages from  user contributed  repositories
   you should always invoke fakeroot:

  $ fakeroot pkgmk -d

      Useful scripts

   Regarding package and ports management there  are many tasks which can  be
   done in several steps with the  CRUX PPC standard tools introduced  above.
   The port prt-utils  in the opt  repository contains a  collection of  such
   scripts. The usage of these scripts is documented in the corresponding man
   pages. In the documentation section of the CRUX website is an overview  of
   all the scripts in prt-utils.

   needs.

    Configuration Variables in /etc/rc.conf

   The following configuration variables are found in /etc/rc.conf.

   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
   | Variable | Description                                            |    |
   |----------+--------------------------------------------------------|    |
   |          | Specifies which console font to load at system         |    |
   |          | startup. The contents of this variable will be passed  |    |
   | FONT     | as argument to setfont(1). The available fonts are     |    |
   |          | located in /usr/share/kbd/consolefonts/.               |    |
   |          |                                                        |    |
   |          | Example: FONT=default                                  |    |
   |----------+--------------------------------------------------------|    |
   |          | Specifies which console keyboard map to load at system |    |
   |          | startup. The contents of this variable will be passed  |    |
   | KEYMAP   | as argument to loadkeys(1). The available keyboard     |    |
   |          | maps are located in /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/.           |    |
   |          |                                                        |    |
   |          | Example: KEYMAP=sv-latin1                              |    |
   |----------+--------------------------------------------------------|    |
   |          | Specifies the timezone used by the system. The         |    |
   |          | available zone description files are located in        |    |
   | TIMEZONE | /usr/share/zoneinfo/.                                  |    |
   |          |                                                        |    |
   |          | Example: TIMEZONE=Europe/Rome                          |    |
   |----------+--------------------------------------------------------|    |
   |          | Specifies the hostname.                                |    |
   | HOSTNAME |                                                        |    |
   |          | Example: HOSTNAME=pluto                                |    |
   |----------+--------------------------------------------------------|    |
   |          | Specifies the system logging daemon(s) to run at       |    |
   | SYSLOG   | startup.                                               |    |

   |          | Example: SYSLOG=sysklogd                               |    |
   |----------+-------------------------------------------------------------|
   |          | Specifies which services to start at system startup. The    |
   |          | services specified in this array must have a matching       |
   |          | start/stop script in /etc/rc.d/. When entering multi-user   |
   |          | mode the specified scripts will be called in the specified  |
   | SERVICES | order with the argument start. At system shutdown or when   |
   |          | entering single-user mode these scripts will be called in   |
   |          | the reverse order with the argument stop.                   |
   |          |                                                             |
   |          | Example: SERVICES=(crond identd sshd sendmail)              |
   +------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    Generating locales

   Starting with CRUX PPC  2.5, glibc does not  contain all possible  locales
   anymore, thus  you'll  have to  generate  the locales  you  need/use.  The
   following example is  a typical  setup for swedish  users, replace  sv_SE*
   with the locale you want:

  # localedef -i sv_SE -f ISO-8859-1 sv_SE
  # localedef -i sv_SE -f ISO-8859-1 sv_SE.ISO-8859-1
  # localedef -i sv_SE -f UTF-8 sv_SE.utf8

   A 'makelocales' helper script can be found under /crux which may be 
   useful as a starting point for creating whatever locales you require.

    Network Configuration

   The network configuration is found in the service script /etc/rc.d/net. To
   enable this  service  you  need  to  add net  to  the  SERVICES  array  in
   /etc/rc.conf. By  default  this  service script  only  configures  the  lo
   device, you have to  add additional ifconfig(8)  and route(8) commands  if
   you want to setup other network devices (eth0, eth1, etc). Example:

  #!/bin/sh
  #
  # /etc/rc.d/net: start/stop network
  #

  case $1 in
  start)
         # loopback
         /sbin/ip addr add 127.0.0.1/8 dev lo broadcast + scope host
         /sbin/ip link set lo up
         # ethernet
         /sbin/ip addr add 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0 broadcast +
         /sbin/ip link set eth0 up
         # default route
         /sbin/ip route add default via 192.168.1.1
         ;;
  stop)
         /sbin/ip route del default
         /sbin/ip link set eth0 down
         /sbin/ip addr del 192.168.1.100/24 dev eth0
         /sbin/ip link set lo down
         /sbin/ip addr del 127.0.0.1/8 dev lo
         ;;
  restart)
         $0 stop
         $0 start
         ;;
  *)
         echo "usage: $0 [start|stop|restart]"
         ;;
  esac

  # End of file

   If you want  to configure  your system  to be a  DHCP client  you use  the
   dhcpcd(8) command (instead of ifconfig(8)). Example:

  #!/bin/sh
  #
  # /etc/rc.d/net: start/stop network
  #

  case $1 in
  start)
         # loopback
         /sbin/ip addr add 127.0.0.1/8 dev lo broadcast + scope host
         /sbin/ip link set lo up
         # ethernet
         /sbin/dhcpcd -t 10 -h $HOSTNAME eth0
         ;;
  stop)
         /usr/bin/killall -q /sbin/dhcpcd
         /sbin/ip link set lo down
         /sbin/ip addr del 127.0.0.1/8 dev lo
         ;;
  restart)
         $0 stop
         $0 start
         ;;
  *)
         echo "usage: $0 [start|stop|restart]"
         ;;
  esac

  # End of file

  Passwords

   CRUX PPC uses MD5SUM passwords by default.  This can be turned off if  you
   instead want to use the traditional  DES passwords. Note however that  DES
   passwords are considered less secure.  To disable MD5SUM passwords  change
   the MD5_CRYPT_ENAB variable in /etc/login.defs to no.

   Further, when  compiling  programs  that  use  the  crypt(3)  function  to
   authenticate users you  should make  sure that these  programs are  linked
   against the  libcrypt  library  (i.e.  use  -lcrypt  when  linking)  which
   contains the  MD5SUM  version  of  the crypt  function  (this  version  is
   backwards compatible and understands DES passwords as well).

  Upgrading the Kernel

   The kernel  source,  which  is  found  in  /usr/src/linux-4.19.xx/  is  not
   installed using  pkgadd. If  you decide  to upgrade  your kernel  you  can
   safely do so by manually replacing the kernel source with a newer  version
   (or place it  somewhere else).  This will  not make  the package  database
   inconsistent (since it's not installed with pkgadd) nor will it affect the
   kernel headers  found  in /usr/include/linux  and  /usr/include/asm  since
   these are not symlinks to the kernel source, but instead contain copies of
   the headers.

Appendix

  Troubleshooting

   Many common  problems  are  answered  in the  CRUX  PPC  frequently  asked
   questions document and  in the  CRUX one,  so if  you experience  problems
   please check  whether  http://www.github.com/cruxppc contains  answers  to  your
   questions already.

  Installation

   1. When booting from the CRUX PPC CD-ROM I get a kernel panic saying:

  " kernel panic - not syncing:  VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0) "

   This can happen if you have more than one CD-ROM drive. Make sure you boot
   from then "first" CD-ROM drive, i.e. /dev/sr0.

   In some cases adding 'rootdelay=20' to the kernel command line may solve
   this problem.

   2. When logging in to my newly  installed CRUX for the first time it  asks
   for a  password,  but the  installation  guide  says "Login  as  root  (no
   password required)". What's wrong?

   You most likely forgot to edit  /mnt/etc/fstab before you rebooted or  you
   entered the wrong name of your new root parition at the boot prompt.

  Configuration

   1. How do I get sshd running?

   You have to edit /etc/hosts.deny and/or /ets/hosts.allow to specify  which
   hosts are  allowed/denied  access. To  allow  anyone to  connect  to  your
   machine you can add sshd: ALL to /etc/hosts.allow. See the hosts_access(5)
   man-page for further information about the file format. When this is  done
   you can start  sshd by  entering the command  /etc/rc.d/sshd start  and/or
   edit /etc/rc.conf and add sshd  to the SERVICES array, i.e.  SERVICES=(...
   sshd ...), which means that sshd will be started when the system boots.

   2. Firefox crashes or refuses to start, what's wrong?

   Firefox is extremely sensitive to missing fonts.cache-1 files. If  firefox
   refuses to start (due to  segmentation violation or just silent  permature
   termination) it is most likely becuase  the font cache files are  missing.
   Run  fc-cache  (as  root)  to  create/update  the  cache  files.  See  the
   fc-cache(1) man page for information about this program.
